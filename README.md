# NovAI
NovAi is a visual novel concept, the concept of which is to provide as much genre, story diversity as possible, in order to improve the game experience.
To ensure this, artificial intelligence will be added to the game.  
## How will it be work?
The creation of the new game will be divided into three phases:
1. Before the game starts, the AI, which works with text, will generate the main storyline, then break it down into smaller components for a more detailed description.
The story will be divided into chapters, events, locations, dialog and specific lines, as well as the characters involved. Player decisions will also be generated,
that will change the course of the story.
2. After the story is fully generated, a neural network capable of generating images will start working. It will create the character's appearance based on the description of the first neural network, 
and also generate images of him with different emotions, poses and so on. The backgrounds will be created according to the same principle.
3. Then in the final compilation all the information will be sapostavlivaet and the player will be able to start his game.
## The real value of the project.
With modern technologies the creation of such a game is quite possible tk. we already have prototypes of all necessary neural networks. Adding AI will open up a lot of possibilities
for development, for example:
1. Creating unlimited unique stories, in different genres.
2. Improved customization, the player will be able to enter some of the parameters that will start the generation.
3. The possibility of adding the function of complete freedom of the player in action, he will be able to directly answer the questions of characters and make important decisions through typing.
4. This all together will help to create an approach to the game where everything will not be prescribed in advance in scripts, and will provide complete freedom of action.
